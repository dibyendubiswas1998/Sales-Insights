## Data Descriptions:

**After a quick data exploration in MySQL, here are some initial findings:**<br>

* The database contains 5 tables: customers, date, markets, products, and transactions;
* There are 17 markets, 279 products, and 38 customers;
* The observation period is from january 2018 to june 2020;
* The total revenue in 2020 was $ 142,23 Mi, 42% less than 2019, which was $ 336,45 Mi;
* Most of the transactions data are in INR currency, but we have 4 records in U$ currency.
* And we got Paris and New York on the “sales markets” table. We’re going to deal with it in the ETL process.
